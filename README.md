# Floppy-Bot

Floppy-Bot is a Discord bot with a variety of features, including displaying server and user information, deleting messages, and sending messages. More features will be added in the near future.

## Getting Started

To use Floppy-Bot, you'll need to set up a Discord application and bot account, and then invite the bot to your Discord server. You'll also need to set up a `.env` file with your Discord bot token.

Once you've done that, you can run the bot using the command `npm start`.

## Usage

Floppy-Bot currently supports the following commands:

- `!ping`: Returns "Pong!" to let you know the bot is working.
- `!server`: Displays information about the current server, including the number of members and the server's ID.
- `!user <@user>`: Displays information about the specified user, including their username, discriminator, and ID.
- `!delete <number>`: Deletes the specified number of messages from the current channel.
- `!say <message>`: Sends a message to the current channel as the bot.
